Steps:

1)Run the Python script: **Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed (Tkinter, pygame)**. Save the script in a .py file and execute it using your Python interpreter.

2)The GUI window will appear with a "Countdown Clock and Timer" title.

3)Set the timer duration:

Enter the number of hours in the "hrs" Entry field.

Enter the number of minutes in the "mins" Entry field.

Enter the number of seconds in the "sec" Entry field.

4)Click the "START" button to start the countdown timer. The timer will count down from the specified time.

#When the timer reaches 00:00:00, a sound (Beep.mp3) will play as an alert.


IMPORTANT:

**Please note that the code is set up to play a sound when the timer reaches 00:00:00. Ensure that you have a sound file named "Beep.mp3" in the same directory as your script or provide the correct path to the sound file for it to work as expected.**
